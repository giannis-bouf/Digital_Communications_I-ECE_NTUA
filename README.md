## 📖 Course Overview
The course covers the fundamental principles of digital signal transmission and reception. Key topics include:
* **Baseband Transmission:** PAM signaling, Pulse shaping (Nyquist criterion, Raised Cosine).
* **Stochastic Processes & Noise:** Analysis of AWGN channels and SNR impact.
* **Digital Modulations:** M-ary PAM, PSK, QAM, and FSK.
* **Performance Analysis:** Calculation and simulation of Bit Error Rate (BER) vs. $E_b/N_0$.
* **Optimal Receivers:** Matched Filter and Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into distinct laboratory units:

| Folder / Lab | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Lab 1/`** | Signal Analysis, PAM modulations, and Pulse Shaping (Nyquist). |
| **`Lab 2/`** | Performance of Baseband systems in the presence of AWGN. |
| **`Lab 3/`** | Passband Modulations (QAM, PSK) and Constellation Diagrams. |
